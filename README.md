## About Me
I am a graduate student in Applied Computing with hands-on experience applying machine learning to real datasets. My work focuses on building end-to-end data pipelines, training predictive models, and interpreting model behavior using explainable AI techniques.

I have worked with tabular and textual data, implementing both classical machine learning algorithms and transformer-based models. My projects include classification, regression, and natural language processing tasks with emphasis on reproducibility and evaluation.

**Areas of interest**
- Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME)
- Applied Machine Learning Systems
